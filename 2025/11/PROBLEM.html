Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles takes all of my free time for months every year. A lot of effort went
into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @was.tl on Bluesky and @ericwastl@hachyderm.io
on Mastodon.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 11: Reactor ---</h2><p>You hear some loud beeping coming from a hatch in the floor of the factory, so you decide to check it out. Inside, you find several large electrical conduits and a ladder.</p>
<p>Climbing down the ladder, you discover the source of the <span title="The beeping is unrelated to the issue with the server rack. The reactor is just hungry.">beeping</span>: a large, toroidal reactor which powers the factory above. Some Elves here are hurriedly running between the reactor and a nearby server rack, apparently trying to fix something.</p>
<p>One of the Elves notices you and rushes over. "It's a good thing you're here! We just installed a new <em>server rack</em>, but we aren't having any luck getting the reactor to communicate with it!" You glance around the room and see a tangle of cables and devices running from the server rack to the reactor. She rushes off, returning a moment later with a list of the devices and their outputs (your puzzle input).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>aaa: you hhh
you: bbb ccc
bbb: ddd eee
ccc: ddd eee fff
ddd: ggg
eee: out
fff: out
ggg: out
hhh: ccc fff iii
iii: out
</code></pre>
<p>Each line gives the name of a device followed by a list of the devices to which its outputs are attached. So, <code>bbb: ddd eee</code> means that device <code>bbb</code> has two outputs, one leading to device <code>ddd</code> and the other leading to device <code>eee</code>.</p>
<p>The Elves are pretty sure that the issue isn't due to any specific device, but rather that the issue is triggered by data following some specific <em>path</em> through the devices. Data only ever flows from a device through its outputs; it can't flow backwards.</p>
<p>After dividing up the work, the Elves would like you to focus on the devices starting with the one next to you (an Elf hastily attaches a label which just says <em><code>you</code></em>) and ending with the main output to the reactor (which is the device with the label <em><code>out</code></em>).</p>
<p>To help the Elves figure out which path is causing the issue, they need you to find <em>every</em> path from <code>you</code> to <code>out</code>.</p>
<p>In this example, these are all of the paths from <code>you</code> to <code>out</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data could take the connection from <code>you</code> to <code>bbb</code>, then from <code>bbb</code> to <code>ddd</code>, then from <code>ddd</code> to <code>ggg</code>, then from <code>ggg</code> to <code>out</code>.</li>
<li>Data could take the connection to <code>bbb</code>, then to <code>eee</code>, then to <code>out</code>.</li>
<li>Data could go to <code>ccc</code>, then <code>ddd</code>, then <code>ggg</code>, then <code>out</code>.</li>
<li>Data could go to <code>ccc</code>, then <code>eee</code>, then <code>out</code>.</li>
<li>Data could go to <code>ccc</code>, then <code>fff</code>, then <code>out</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, there are <code><em>5</em></code> different paths leading from <code>you</code> to <code>out</code>.</p>
<p><em>How many different paths lead from <code>you</code> to <code>out</code>?</em></p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>753</code>.</p><p class="day-success">The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *</p>
<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Thanks in part to your analysis, the Elves have figured out a little bit about the issue. They now know that the problematic data path passes through both <code>dac</code> (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter" target="_blank">digital-to-analog converter</a>) and <code>fft</code> (a device which performs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform" target="_blank">fast Fourier transform</a>).</p>
<p>They're still not sure which specific path is the problem, and so they now need you to find every path from <code>svr</code> (the server rack) to <code>out</code>. However, the paths you find must all also visit both <code>dac</code> <em>and</em> <code>fft</code> (in any order).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>svr: aaa bbb
aaa: fft
fft: ccc
bbb: tty
tty: ccc
ccc: ddd eee
ddd: hub
hub: fff
eee: dac
dac: fff
fff: ggg hhh
ggg: out
hhh: out
</code></pre>
<p>This new list of devices contains many paths from <code>svr</code> to <code>out</code>:</p>
<pre><code>svr,aaa,<em>fft</em>,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,ggg,out
svr,aaa,<em>fft</em>,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,hhh,out
svr,aaa,<em>fft</em>,ccc,eee,<em>dac</em>,fff,ggg,out
svr,aaa,<em>fft</em>,ccc,eee,<em>dac</em>,fff,hhh,out
svr,bbb,tty,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,ggg,out
svr,bbb,tty,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,hhh,out
svr,bbb,tty,ccc,eee,<em>dac</em>,fff,ggg,out
svr,bbb,tty,ccc,eee,<em>dac</em>,fff,hhh,out
</code></pre>
<p>However, only <em><code>2</code></em> paths from <code>svr</code> to <code>out</code> visit both <code>dac</code> and <code>fft</code>.</p>
<p>Find all of the paths that lead from <code>svr</code> to <code>out</code>. <em>How many of those paths visit both <code>dac</code> and <code>fft</code>?</em></p>
